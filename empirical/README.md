# Stated - rating experiment/Empirical data modeling

This package contains tools to develop empirical models that describe the impact of safety perceptions on route/mode choices. These models can be used to calibrate the Perceived Safety Choices model considering the attitudes, the safety perceptions and in general the mobility culture existing in each case. 

The data are collected based on a survey form developed by Tzouras et al. (2020). The form comprises a methodological tool to take into account subjective variables related to users' perceptions in discrete choice modeling. In essense, two experiments have been combined in a single one: a) a rating experiment to measure the subjective variable (e.g., perceived safety) and stated preferences experiment to capture route/mode choices per case. The survey form is given below:
